// JARVIS - TurnTimeline.swift
// Latency breakdown of one voice turn, from "the user stopped talking" to "the reply is speaking".
//
// This is the metric the whole telemetry effort exists for. Chasing perceived slowness by feel
// cost a lot of guessing: the real culprit turned out to be a flat 4s end-of-turn timeout that a
// fast cloud model and a local one paid identically — obvious in one glance at these numbers,
// invisible without them.
//
// Stages, in order:
//   speechEnd   the mic went quiet (acoustic VAD)
//   commit      the turn was handed to a backend
//   firstToken  the model produced its first output       <- "is the MODEL slow?"
//   genDone     the model finished the reply
//   firstAudio  the user actually HEARS something         <- perceived latency ends here
//   spokeDone   playback finished
//
// `perceivedLatency` (speechEnd -> firstAudio) is the headline number: everything before it is
// dead air from the wearer's point of view.
