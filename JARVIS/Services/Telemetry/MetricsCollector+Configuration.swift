// JARVIS - MetricsCollector+Configuration.swift
// Builds the remote sink from saved settings, and restores it at launch.
//
// This exists because the settings were persisted but the SINK was not: it was only attached when
// the user opened Settings → Telemetry and toggled it. Any relaunch — including a jetsam kill
// during a model switch, which is exactly when memory spikes — brought the app back with telemetry
// silently off, and metrics simply stopped arriving with nothing to indicate why.
